List of projects in this repository

* ## [Vending Machine](./VendingMachine/)

The simulation of a vending Machine in C language it covers the inventory tracking and sales operation between seller and the buyer.
The project is designed using C structures to enable all the operations and has two main parts which are the Seller login option and the buyer login option.

* ## [File sorter](./SortMyData/)

Used file operations to read data from `.txt` file and sort the data. After then write the sorted content to output file.
This project uses file operations and Structures to read the student's data from the file sort them and give a new version of sorted data on the output file.

* ## [Playlist](./Playlist/)

Simulation of how music player app works using a linke list where we can add songs to the playlist play them, and delete them.
The project was designed using a LinkedLists to mimic the playlist beahviour where each node represents a certain song and all the list represents the playlist. When playing the songs the time duration of a song is respected before jumping to a next song.

* ## [StoreManager](./StoreManager/)

Using BST to manager store items. In this Project we used the Binary Search tree to organise store Items which makes it easier for the store manager to find ceratain item given he knows the price as all items are organised price wise given that the first item to be in store is considered the Tree root node. It helps to know total cost, display all items and search through the store.
